# 🎨 Design Patterns Playground

Welcome to my **Design Patterns Playground** – a place where I explore, implement, and have fun with classic and modern software design patterns.  
This repository is **not** a strict academic reference — it’s my personal lab for learning, experimenting, and maybe breaking a few rules along the way. 😏

- **Structural Patterns** 🏛 – *e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Composite*
- **Behavioral Patterns** 🎭 – *e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command*
- **Extra Experiments** 🚀 – Random twists, real-world analogies, and silly examples

## 🎯 Goals
1. Understand the *why* behind each pattern
